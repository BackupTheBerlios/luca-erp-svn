    Although currently a function, L{config} will probably become a class
    because we strongly suspect people will want to actually do some
    configuration loading here. In fact, one thing we learned while
    implementing the first Cimarrón is that a lot of functionality is actually
    too installation-dependant to I{not} keep it in a configuration file
    somewhere (an example of this is, of course, the default skin name).

    This Cimarrón is at this time much leaner than its previous incarnation,
    and thus the only work done by L{config} is the choosing of the
    appropriate skin (and loading thereof). Expect this to change as the
    L{Controller <cimarron.controllers.Controller>}s and L{Widget
    <cimarron.skins.common.Widget>}s are filled out.
