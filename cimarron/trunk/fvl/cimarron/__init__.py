"""
Cimarr贸n is a framework for the construction of reusable GUI components, using
(recursive) variations of the classic (NeXT-like) MVC pattern. Provided are a
pretty basic set of views (it is trivial to add more, and more will be provided
as the PAPO project advances), and a few controllers. Also provided is a small
example.

    Although currently a function, L{_config} will probably become a class
    because we strongly suspect people will want to actually do some
    configuration loading here. In fact, one thing we learned while
    implementing the first Cimarr贸n is that a lot of functionality is actually
    too installation-dependant to I{not} keep it in a configuration file
    somewhere (an example of this is, of course, the default skin name).

    This Cimarr贸n is at this time much leaner than its previous incarnation,
    and thus the only work done by L{_config} is the choosing of the
    appropriate skin (and loading thereof). Expect this to change as the
    L{Controller <fvl.cimarron.controllers.Controller>}s and L{Widget
    <fvl.cimarron.skins.common.Widget>}s are filled out.
