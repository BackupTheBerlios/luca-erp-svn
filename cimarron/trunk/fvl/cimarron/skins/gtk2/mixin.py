"""
From http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MixIn:

    A mixin class is a parent class that is inherited from - but not
    as a means of specialization. Typically, the mixin will export
    services to a child class, but no semantics will be implied about
    the child "being a kind of" the parent.

For some examples see UserDict.DictMixin, and
http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MixinsForPython.

In this module live gtk2-skin-specific mixins; as such, they assume
they'll be subclassed by subclasses of L{Widget}. Mixins can do that.
