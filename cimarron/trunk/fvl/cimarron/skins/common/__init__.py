        Request delegates' consensus over whether a certain action should be
        performed.

        L{Control}s (L{Button <skins.gtk2.Button>}, L{Entry
        <skins.gtk2.Entry>}, L{Controller <controllers.Controller>} itself,
        etc.)  have a purpose in life, and that purpose is to react to a given
        action when acted on. You press a button, and bam! the action is shot
        out (for example, 'Close'). The connection is direct and unequivocal;
        if the button is enabled the action will be carried out.

        However, other kinds of interaction are possible as is the example of
        closing a window: in these cases the manipulation is more direct,
        while the process of deciding if the action should be carried out is
        more subtle, and the actors involved might be spread out over the
        L{Controller <controllers.Controller>} hierarchy. Delegation is a
        means of permitting these concensus-like desicions processes to occur,
        while leaving the logic for the decisions themselves next to the
        decision makers.

        Every object that delegates actions has a list of delegates. When an
        action occurs the C{delegates} list is traversed, asking each delegate
        what they think of the action. Based on the opinion of the delegates,
        the action is carried out or vetoed.

        The delegates that care about an action must have a method named after
        the action (for example, if a delegate cares about 'hide' events it
        would have a 'will_hide' method). The method will be called to querie
        the delegate about the action, and the delegate must return one of the
        following:

          - L{ForcedNo}: halt traversal, do not perform the action.
          - L{No}: 'I vote no'; traversal continues.
          - L{Unknown}: same as not having the method: ignore this vote.
          - L{Yes}: 'I vote yes'; traversal continues.
          - L{ForcedYes}: halt traversal, perform the action.

        a single 'Yes' in a chain full of 'No's is a 'Yes' (in other
        words, a list of non-forced results is ORed).
