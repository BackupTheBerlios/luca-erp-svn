Cimarrón is a framework for the construction of reusable GUI
components, using (recursive) variations of the classic (NeXT-like)
MVC pattern. Provided are a pretty basic set of views (it is trivial to
add more, and more will be provided as the PAPO project advances), and
a few controllers. Also provided is a small example.

The aim of Cimarrón is to be toolkit-agnostic, but we've only had time
to implement the Gtk2 'skin' so far.

As there are several takes on what MVC means, we'll try to explain it
here.
